# 🌈 BlobPlop One-Stop Shop API 🍦

This express server routes requests that require keys for my front-ends.

It also houses a discord bot or two.

Starter code thanks to [create-express-api](https://github.com/w3cj/create-express-api#readme)

## TODOs

- [ ] TypeScript Time?
- [ ] Refactor app.js, it's getting busy
- [ ] Host game stats outside of the code to schedule automatic updates
- [ ] Rate limit openai-using code (budget is set, at least)
